# Football App created with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About the app

An interactive and responsive UI design for a webapp that displays football related details and statistics

## Explanation 

* The webapp is intended for both mobile and desktop users. An attractive and responsive UI design created purely in React JavaScript library coupled with utility-based CSS frameworks like Tailwind and DaisyUI.
* There is no current backend utility or any database integrated with the application.
* The football data utilized by the application is in turn fetched through APIs like [API football](https://www.api-football.com/) and some static data obtained from [Open Football Github Repo](https://github.com/openfootball/football.json) and [Kaggle FIFA 22 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/fifa-22-complete-player-dataset). 
* Since the app was not aimed to fulfill any business requirements, the paid APIs usage is currently been eliminated and only dummy data values will be displayed at various routes in the App.
